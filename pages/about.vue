  <p class="font-body text-2xl">
Before becoming frontend developer, i worked as a full stack web developer (LAMP) for different companies. where i used to develop web applications in PHP, Laravel, Codeigniter, VueJS.
2018 was some year! The biggest change was starting learning deeply in frontend technologies. In 2019 i have Made a switch from a full stack developer to a frontend developer. I'm glad I made the decision. It was a year full of learnings; learning new tech/tools for work, time management, effective communication and overcoming my anxieties!
I also, started focussing on great UI.

  <p class="font-body text-2xl pt-6">I look forward for opportunities as a developer to create meaningful products.</p>
